identifier in alphabetical order should also be preferred.

to land, passengers allowed to disembark, and the time advanced by one hour until
the next takeoff to allow for preparations.

If an airplane is on the ground and waiting to takeoff, then the passengers should
be allowed to board, and the time should be advanced to represent when the airplane
will land at its next location based on the leg distance and airplane speed.

If an airplane is on the ground and has reached the end of its route, then the
flight crew should be recycled to allow rest, and the flight itself should be
retired from the system. */
